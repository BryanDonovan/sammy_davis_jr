A simple, concise framework for doing MVC web development. With only 120 lines of carefully-controlled code, it is my attempt to boil down web development to a perfect balance between the productivity of conventions, and the freedom of simplicity.

This is the web development framework I use for myself. It is the ultimate expression of what I believe web development should be, collated through my decade of experience creating web sites. It encourages craftsmanship over conformity, only providing convention where it is truly useful, otherwise staying out of the way. Improvement without constraint.

Feel free to use, study, or hate.
